#1 Create a matrix StudentMarks which stores the marks scored by 5 students in 4 courses.
StudentMarks = matrix(c(50, 60, 70, 60,100, 90, 87, 90,70, 100, 90, 90,30, 65, 50, 50,58, 50, 74, 43), nrow = 5, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

rownames(StudentMarks)=c("Vishwajeet","Dishant","Dazzle","Shashank","Ujan")
print(StudentMarks)

```{r}
#2 Find the class average of each course.
print(colMeans(StudentMarks))
```
```{r}
#3 Find the total score of each student.
print(rowSums(StudentMarks))
```
```{r}
#4 Print the marks scored by all the students in subject 1 and subject4.
marks_sub = StudentMarks[, c(1, 4)]

#5 Include the marks scored by a new student in all the courses.

#6  Create a matrix A with sequence of numbers from 21 to 32 in row major with 3 rows.
A = matrix(21:32, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
print(A)
```
```{r}
#7 Check whether A is symmetric
isSymmetric(A)
```

```{r}
#8 Create matrix B by slicing only the first three columns of Matrix A
B = A[, 1:3]
print(B)

#9 Find the mean, determinant and rank of Matrix B
x = mean(B)

#11. Create a matrix by following the statements:

    #Create a vector named Rohith with three values.
      Rohith = c(75, 80, 85)

    #Create a vector named Bharath with three values.
      Bharath = c(85, 90, 83)

    #Create a vector named Kevin with three values.
      Kevin = c(75, 86, 90)

    #From the above three vectors construct a row major matrix named Marks with 3 rows.
      Marks = matrix(c(Rohith, Bharath, Kevin), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

    #Print the Marks matrix.
      print(Marks)

    #Print the Marks matrix

#12. Find the following from the above matrix:

    #Find the total score of each person and name it as Total
      Total = rowSums(Marks)
      print(Total)
      
    #Add that column to the existing matrix and name the new matrix as Final_Marks

      print(Final_Marks)
      
    #Find the average score of all the components of Final_marks matrix(CAT-1, CAT-2, FAT and Total). Round it to 2 decimal places.[Note: use round function]
      avg_scores = round(colMeans(Final_Marks), 2)
      print(avg_scores)
      
    #Append the avg score in Final_Marks
